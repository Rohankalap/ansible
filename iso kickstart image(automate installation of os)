Topic: I want to create completely unattended installation of Iso(kickstart).

-> I have created VMs using ansible scripts which creates VMs with iso image attached to it 
but when ever we start those machines they starts from boot options I want to automate that process of installation

I have followed these sites to create kickstart iso image but there is some problem with it.

1. http://gyk.lt/ubuntu-14-04-desktop-unattended-installation/     
2. http://gyk.lt/ubuntu-16-04-desktop-unattended-installation/
    - i have created kickstart.cfg file copied to iso folder
    - and preseed file too

I will try this process to see if it works
